# Geoserver_initd
Add Geoserver as a service (init.d)  in CENTOS 6
I had create an init script in Centos  6, you can run the startup.sh as a service,, is useful if you are using a VPS.

In my case, the GEOSERVER_HOME is /usr/share/geoserver

NOTE:
run the script if your current directory is: /usr/share/geoserver/bin/

In order to install geoserver please check:
